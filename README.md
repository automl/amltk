# AutoML Toolkit
A framework for building an AutoML System. The toolkit is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to
easily swap out components and integrate your own. The toolkit is designed to be used in a variety of different
ways, whether for research purposes, building your own AutoML Tool or educational purposes.

We focus on building complex parametrized pipelines easily, providng tools to optimize these pipeline parameters and
lastly, providing tools to schedule compute tasks on a variety of different compute backends, without the need to
refactor everything, once you swap out any one of these.

The goal of this toolkit is to drive innovation for AutoML Systems by:
1. Allowing concise research artifacts that can study different design decisions in AutoML.
2. Enabling simple prototypes to scale to the compute you have available.
3. Providing a framework for building real and robust AutoML Systems that are extensible by design.

To install from source, you can clone this repo and install with `pip`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:automl/amltk.git
pip install -e amltk  # -e for editable mode
```

If planning to contribute, you can install the development dependancies but we
highly recommend checking out our [contributing guide](https://automl.github.io/amltk/latest/contributing) for more.

```bash
pip install -e "amltk[dev]"
```


## Features
Here's a brief overview of 3 of the core components from the toolkit:

### Pipelines
Define **parametrized** machine learning pipelines using a fluid API:
```python
from amltk.pipeline import Component, Choice, Sequential
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClasifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.svm import SVC

pipeline = (
    Sequential(name="my_pipeline")
    >> Component(SimpleImputer, space={"strategy": ["mean", "median"]}),  # Choose either mean or median
    >> OneHotEncoder(drop="first")  # No parametrization, no problem
    >> Choice(
        # Our pipeline can choose between two different estimators
        Component(
            RandomForestClassifier,
            space={
                "n_estimators": (10, 100),
                "criterion": ["gini", "log_loss"]
            },
            config={"max_depth":3}
        ),
        Component(SVC, space={"kernel": ["linear", "rbf", "poly"]}),
        name="estimator"
    )
)

# Parser the search space with implemented or you custom parser
search_space = pipeline.search_space(parser=...)

# Configure a pipeline
configured_pipeline = pipeline.configure(config)

# Build the pipeline with a build, no amltk code in your built model
model = configured_pipeline.build(builder="sklearn")
```

### Optimizers
Optimize your pipelines using a variety of different optimizers, with a unified API and
a suite of utility for recording and taking control of the optimization loop:

```python
from amltk.optimization import Trial, Metric, History

pipeline = ...
accuracy = Metric("accuracy", maximize=True, bounds=(0. 1))
inference_time = Metric("inference_time", maximize=False)

def evaluate(trial: Trial) -> Trial.Report:

    # Say when and where you trial begins
    with trial.begin():
        model = pipeline.configure(trial.config).build("sklearn")

        # Profile the things you'd like
        with trial.profile("fit"):
            model.fit(...)

        # Record anything else you'd like
        trial.summary["model_size"] = ...

        # Store whatever you'd like
        trial.store({"model.pkl": model, "predictions.npy": predictions}),
        return trial.success(accuracy=0.8, inference_time=...)

    if trial.exception:
        return trial.fail()

# Easily swap between optimizers, without needing to change the rest of your code
from amltk.optimization.optimizers.smac import SMACOptimizer
from amltk.optimization.optimizers.smac import OptunaOptimizer
import random

Optimizer = random.choice([SMACOptimizer, OptunaOptimizer])
smac_optimizer = Optimizer(space=pipeline, metrics=[accuracy, inference_time], bucket="results")


# You decide how your optimization loop should work
history = History()
for _ in range(10):
    trial = optimizer.ask()
    report = evaluate(trial)
    history.add(report)
    optimizer.tell(report)

print(history.df())
```

> same API we use!

### Scheduling
Schedule your optimization jobs or AutoML tasks on a variety of different compute backends. By leveraging
compute workers and asyncio, you can easily scale your compute needs, react to events as they happen and
swap backends, without needing to modify your code!

```python
from amltk.scheduling import Scheduler

# Create a Scheduler with a backend, here 4 processes
scheduler = Scheduler.with_processes(4)
# scheduler = Scheduler.with_SLURM(...)
# scheduler = Scheduler.with_OAR(...)
# scheduler = Scheduler(executor=my_own_compute_backend)

# Define some compute and wrap it as a task to offload to the scheduler
def expensive_function(x: int) -> float:
    return (2 ** x) / x

task = scheduler.task(expensive_function)

numbers = range(-5, 5)
results = []

# When the scheduler starts, submit 4 tasks to the processes
@scheduler.on_start(repeat=4)
def on_start():
    n = next(numbers)
    task.submit(n)

# When the task is done, store the result
@task.on_result
def on_result(_, result: float):
    results.append(result)

# Easy to incrementently add more functionallity
@task.on_result
def launch_next(_, result: float):
    if (n := next(numbers, None)) is not None:
        task.submit(n)

# React to issues when they happen
@task.on_exception
def stop_something_went_wrong(_, exception: Exception):
    scheduler.stop()

# Start the scheduler and run it as you like
scheduler.run(timeout=10)

# ... await scheduler.async_run() for servers and real-time applications
```
