# Metalearning
An important part of AutoML systems is to perform well on new unseen data.
There are a variety of methods to do so but we provide some building blocks
to help implement these methods.

!!! warning "API"

    The meta-learning features have not been extensively used yet
    and such no solid API has been developed yet. We will
    deprecate any API subject to change before changing them.
