        !!! note "Forcibully Terminating Workers"

            As an `Executor` does not provide an interface to forcibly
            terminate workers, we provide `terminate` as a custom
            strategy for cleaning up a provided executor. It is not possible
            to terminate running thread based workers, for example using
            `ThreadPoolExecutor` and any Executor using threads to spawn
            tasks will have to wait until all running tasks are finish
            before python can close.

        Args:
            executor: The dispatcher to use for submitting tasks.
            terminate: Whether to call shutdown on the executor when
                `run(..., wait=False)`. If True, the executor will be
                `shutdown(wait=False)` and we will attempt to terminate
                any workers of the executor. For some `Executors` this
                is enough, i.e. Dask, however for something like
                `ProcessPoolExecutor`, we will use `psutil` to kill
                its worker processes. If a callable, we will use this
                function for custom worker termination.
                If False, shutdown will not be called and the executor will
                remain active.
